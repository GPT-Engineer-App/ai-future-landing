# ai-future-landing

A landing page for an AI chatbot service with a design that feels distinctly futuristic and AI-inspired. The design will be executed using CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive elements such as animated backgrounds, sleek hover effects, and smooth transitions. The color scheme will primarily feature tech-inspired blues and grays, complemented by occasional vibrant accent colors to enhance the futuristic feel. The layout will be clean, with a strong focus on typography and space to keep it modern and easy to navigate.
